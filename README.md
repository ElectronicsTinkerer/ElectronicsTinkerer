## Hello!

Glad to see you stop by! By day, I'm a professional rectangle drawer (computer architecture engineer) and C# programmer. When not at my day job, I do embedded system HW/FW stuff, a fair bit of 3D CAD, and some occasional tool chain development for weird hardware (e.g. custom ISAs).

- **Common languages**: C, C#, Rust, Python, various ASMs

- **Less common**: JS, HTML, CSS, Perl, PHP, TCL, Spanish 😉

📺 Pretty much my only social: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@electronicstinkerer5429)

🌐 Oh, and I have a website: [ZRCN.ORG](https://zrcn.org)
